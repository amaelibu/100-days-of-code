### Day 27: February 4, 2020
##### 

**Progress**: completed the CSS tutorial lessons on Freecodecamp!
**Thoughts**: today went much smoother than yesterday. i think that the differenc was that i was not trying to complete a certain number of lessons in a given amount of time. i focused on understanding the lessons and moved along nicely. i did use the hint video 4 times towards the end, so i may revisit those sections. was very interested in the fallback values; typos are my Achilles' heel.
